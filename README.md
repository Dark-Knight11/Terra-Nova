## Problem Statement 
The carbon market today is opaque, expensive, and unreliable.
Project developers face high registration costs, long approval cycles, and extreme price volatility, making climate finance unpredictable.

Buyers cannot verify the integrity or authenticity of credits, and the absence of transparency leads to fraud, double counting, and loss of trust.

There is no fair pricing, no liquidity, and no automation for discovering or purchasing high-quality credits.

## Overview of the App
Carbon Block is a decentralized carbon credit protocol that brings full transparency, fair pricing, and intelligent automation to the carbon market.
It manages the entire lifecycle of carbon credits on-chain, uses an Integrity Scoring Engine to assess credit quality, provides AMM-based fair pricing with liquidity pools, and deploys Agentic AI to help buyers automatically discover, evaluate, purchase, and retire credits, all with verifiable on-chain proof.
